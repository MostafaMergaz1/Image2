I'm excited to share my latest project — an interactive image filtering web application built using Python, Streamlit, and OpenCV. 🖼️💡

🔍 What it does:
This app allows users to upload any image and apply a variety of visual filters and effects in real-time. The goal is to provide a fast and user-friendly way to explore how computer vision techniques can transform images.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

Streamlit

OpenCV

NumPy / PIL

🎨 Available Effects:

Grayscale conversion

Cartoon & Sketch effect

Sepia filter

HDR & Stylization

Image sharpening

Vintage look

Color inversion

Old photo enhancemen
